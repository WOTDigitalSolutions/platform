# Mockup Asset Plan

## Objective
Create a coherent set of device mockups for marketing collateral, proposal deck, and social campaigns.

## Asset List
1. **Desktop** – Apostolic Network dashboard overview.
2. **Laptop** – Ministry Hub resource library with AI summary sidebar.
3. **Tablet (Portrait)** – Starter Site sermon page with media embeds.
4. **Tablet (Landscape)** – Attendance report submission form.
5. **Mobile** – Quick prayer request form + giving CTA.
6. **Mobile Carousel** – Three-screen journey: Home → Sermon → Give.

## Design Specifications
- Use brand palette: deep navy (#0C1B3C), warm gold (#F7B643), soft alabaster (#F5F6F9), accent coral (#F15A4A).
- Typography consistent with digital product (headings `Playfair Display`, body `Inter`).
- Maintain real copy snippets aligned with ministry messaging (avoid lorem ipsum).
- Include subtle AI badges on dashboards summarizing “AI-generated insights” when relevant.

## Workflow
1. Collect screenshots from staging builds (Phase 1 for Starter Site, Phase 2+ for dashboards).
2. Use Figma or Photoshop smart-object mockups for device frames (MacBook, iPad, iPhone, Android).
3. Overlay contextual headlines and callouts (e.g., “Automated Growth Summary”).
4. Export high-resolution PNGs and web-optimized versions (≤500 KB) for web use.
5. Store assets in shared drive under `Marketing/Mockups` with naming convention `tier-device-version.png`.

## Distribution
- Landing page hero & tier sections.
- Proposal PDF package highlights.
- Social teasers (WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram).
- Demo video cutaway shots.

## Next Actions
- Source premium device mockup templates (Envato, Figma Community) — shortlist by Day 3.
- Coordinate with Claude to capture UI once components stabilize.
- Maintain changelog to update mockups when UI evolves post-feedback.
