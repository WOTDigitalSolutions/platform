## Internal Notes (Remove Before Client-Facing Use)

**Cost Structure (Internal):**
- Infrastructure: ~$10-30/month per client (Supabase, Vercel, Cloudinary)
- AI API: ~$5-20/month per Hub/Portal client (Claude)
- Labor: ~20-40 hours per project (Starter = 20h, Hub = 30h, Portal = 40h)

**Target Margins:**
- Starter Site: $200 - $30 (infra/year) - $100 (labor @ $5/hr) = **$70 profit** → 35% margin
- Ministry Hub: $500 - $50 (infra/year) - $150 (labor) = **$300 profit** → 60% margin
- Network Portal: $1000 - $100 (infra/year) - $200 (labor) = **$700 profit** → 70% margin

**Break-Even:**
- 3 Starter Sites = cover monthly costs ($600)
- 1 Hub + 1 Starter = cover costs + small profit
- 1 Portal = cover costs + reinvest in marketing

**18-Week Goal:**
- 5-10 clients × $300 avg = $1,500-3,000 revenue
- Costs: ~$700 (infra, tools, marketing)
- Net: $800-2,300 profit
