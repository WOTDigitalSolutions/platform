- Current tools don't scale with network growth

### User Story

## Cross-Persona Insights

### Common Needs
- **Simplicity:** All personas need intuitive, "ministry-logic" interfaces
- **Mobile-first:** Most users access via smartphones
- **Reliability:** Must work consistently without technical support
- **Purpose-built:** Generic business tools don't fit ministry workflows

### Key Differentiators
- **Emerging Minister:** Needs credibility + basic functionality
- **Team Leader:** Needs organization + insights
- **Network Apostle:** Needs control + scalability

### Design Principles
1. **Ministry-first language:** Use "sermons" not "content," "branches" not "locations"
2. **Low friction:** Minimize clicks, pre-populate forms, use sensible defaults
3. **Offline-resilient:** Handle poor internet connectivity gracefully
4. **Multi-device:** Seamless experience across phone, tablet, desktop
