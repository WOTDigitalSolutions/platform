Hello Sir/Ma,

I hope this message meets you well in the Lord!

I wanted to share something exciting with you. I've launched WOT Digital Solutions – a new service helping ministers build professional websites and digital platforms.

We're purpose-built for ministry (not generic business sites). Think:
• Sermon players with YouTube/audio
• Online giving (Flutterwave)
• Prayer request forms
• Team dashboards for reports

Prices: $200-$1000 (wayyyy cheaper than agencies)
Delivery: 7-10 days (not months!)

I'm offering the first 5 clients a "Foundation Partner" discount (20% off).

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call this week to see if it's a fit? No pressure at all – just wanted you to know about it first!

Blessings,
Rev. Premma

### Script 3: Value-First Approach (Offer Free Resource)

Hello Pastor [Name],

I pray this meets you well!

I'm Rev. Premma, and I help ministries simplify their admin through digital tools. I put together a free resource that might be helpful:

**"5 Ways To Organize Ministry Reports (Without WhatsApp Chaos)"**

It's a simple PDF with practical tips – would you like me to send it?

No strings attached – just want to serve! 😊

(P.S. If you're ever considering a church website or platform, I also run WOT Digital Solutions. But the resource is free either way!)

Blessings,
Rev. Premma

## Email Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Introduction Email (Cold)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Church Name]'s digital presence

**Body:**

```
Dear Pastor [Name],

My name is Rev. Premma, and I help Christian ministries build professional websites and digital platforms.

I came across [Church Name] and was blessed by [specific thing]. I wanted to reach out because many ministries I work with struggle with:

• No online presence (or an outdated site)
• Scattered ministry reports (WhatsApp, email, Excel)
• No way to collect online giving
• Difficulty coordinating multiple branches/teams

If any of these resonate, I'd love to offer you a free 15-minute discovery call to see if WOT Digital Solutions can help.

**What We Do:**
• Ministry Starter Sites: 5-page websites with sermons, giving, forms ($200)
• Ministry Hubs: Team portals with reports and dashboards ($500)
• Network Portals: Multi-branch management platforms ($1,000)

**Our Promise:**
• Delivered in 7-10 days (not months)
• Purpose-built for ministry (not generic templates)
• Fair pricing (10x cheaper than agencies)
• Free support included

No pressure – just wanted to introduce myself and let you know we're here if you ever need us!

Would you be open to a brief call this week?

Blessings in Christ,

### Template 2: Follow-Up Email (No Response)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about [Church Name]'s digital presence

**Body:**

```
Hello Pastor [Name],

Just following up on my previous email about WOT Digital Solutions.

I understand you're likely busy (ministry never stops!), so no worries if now isn't the right time.

But if you're ever considering:
• A new church website
• A team portal for reports
• A network management platform

...I'd love to help!

Feel free to reach out anytime – even if it's 6 months from now. I'm here to serve when you're ready.

Blessings,

### Template 3: Case Study/Portfolio Email

**Subject:** See how WOT Digital Solutions helped [Example Church]

**Body:**

```
Dear Pastor [Name],

I wanted to share a quick success story from a recent project:

**Challenge:**
[Example Church] had 12 cell leaders sending attendance reports via WhatsApp every week. Pastor [Name] was spending hours compiling data manually.

**Solution:**
We built them a Ministry Hub with a team portal. Now leaders submit reports through the dashboard, and Pastor [Name] sees everything at a glance – filtered by date, team, or location.

**Result:**
• 80% of reports now submitted digitally (not WhatsApp)
• Pastor [Name] saves 5+ hours per week
• Clear visibility into which teams need support

**Time:** 10 days from kickoff to launch
**Cost:** $500 (one-time payment)

If [Church Name] faces similar challenges, I'd love to chat about how we can help.

## Phone Call Script

### Opening (30 seconds)

"Hello, this is Rev. Premma from WOT Digital Solutions. Is this a good time for a quick chat?"

**If YES:**
"Great! I wanted to reach out because we help ministries like [Church Name] build professional websites and digital platforms – without the high costs or long wait times. Do you currently have a website or any digital tools for your ministry?"

**If NO:**
"No problem! When would be a better time for me to call back? I'll only need 10-15 minutes."

---

### Discovery Questions (2-3 minutes)

1. "Do you currently have a church website? If so, how's it working for you?"
   - *Listen for pain points: outdated, hard to update, expensive to maintain*

2. "How do you currently handle things like sermon distribution, prayer requests, or online giving?"
   - *Listen for: scattered tools, manual processes, frustration*

3. "If you have a team or multiple branches, how do you collect reports (attendance, outreach, etc.)?"
   - *Listen for: WhatsApp chaos, Excel spreadsheets, no visibility*

4. "If you could wave a magic wand and have the perfect digital setup, what would it include?"
   - *Listen for: their dream solution, budget hints, timeline*

---

### Pitch (2-3 minutes)

"Based on what you shared, I think [Package Name] would be a great fit. Let me explain what's included..."

**For Starter Site:**
"You'd get a 5-page website with sermon uploads, online giving through Flutterwave, and contact/prayer request forms. Everything mobile-responsive. We'd have you launched in 7-10 days for $200."

**For Ministry Hub:**
"On top of a website, you'd get a secure team portal where your leaders can submit reports, access resources, and you'd have an admin dashboard to see everything. We even include AI-powered summaries. $500, delivered in 10-14 days."

**For Network Portal:**
"For a network like yours, you need branch-level isolation, network-wide dashboards, and role-based access. You'd see all your branches in one place, with automated monthly summaries. $1,000, delivered in 3-4 weeks."

---

### Handling Objections

**Objection 1: "That's too expensive."**

**Response:**
"I totally understand budget is a concern. Can I ask – what were you expecting to invest? Also, compared to agencies charging $5,000-10,000, we're actually 10x more affordable. Plus, it's a one-time payment (no monthly subscriptions). And right now, we're offering Foundation Partner pricing at 20% off for our first 5 clients."

---

**Objection 2: "I need to think about it / pray about it."**

**Response:**
"Absolutely, that's wise! This is an important decision. Can I ask – what specific questions or concerns do you have that I can help clarify? I want to make sure you have all the info you need to make the best decision for [Church Name]."

**Follow-up:**
"How about this – I'll send you a proposal via email with all the details. You take your time to review and pray, and I'll follow up in a week. Sound good?"

---

**Objection 3: "I already have a website / We're working with someone else."**

**Response:**
"That's great! How's it working for you? Are there any frustrations or features you wish it had?"

**If they're happy:**
"That's awesome – I'm glad you found a solution that works! Keep me in mind if you ever need upgrades or team features. And if you know any other ministers who need a site, I'd appreciate the referral!"

**If they have frustrations:**
"I hear you. A lot of ministries face similar issues. Would you be open to a quick demo of what we offer? No obligation – just to see if there's a better fit."

---

**Objection 4: "I'm not tech-savvy / I don't know how to manage a website."**

**Response:**
"You're not alone – most of our clients say the same thing! That's exactly why we built it simple. If you can use WhatsApp, you can use our platform. Everything is point-and-click, and we include 1-hour training. Plus, free support for the first 1-3 months (depending on your package). We're here to help!"

---

### Closing (1 minute)

**Ask for the sale:**
"So, does [Package Name] sound like a good fit for [Church Name]? If so, I can send you a proposal today and we can get started this week!"

**If YES:**
"Awesome! I'll send the proposal to [email] within the next hour. It'll include all the details, timeline, and payment info. We'll schedule a kickoff call once you're ready to move forward. Sound good?"

**If MAYBE:**
"No problem! How about I send you the proposal anyway so you have it for reference? You can review it, pray about it, and let me know when you're ready. I'll follow up in a week. Fair enough?"

**If NO:**
"I understand – timing might not be right. Can I keep your contact and check back in 3-6 months? Sometimes needs change. And if you ever need anything or know someone who does, feel free to reach out!"
