Attention pastors and ministry leaders 👋

We’ve built WOT Digital Solutions to help you focus on the Word, not the workflow. Whether you’re launching your first ministry site or coordinating multiple branches, we tailor a portal that handles sermons, reports, giving, and discipleship follow-up in one place.

✅ Launch-ready Starter Site in 7–10 days  
✅ Ministry Hub with team login, resource library, and AI summaries  
✅ Apostolic Network Portal for multi-church oversight

Comment “Demo” or DM me to see how it works (Foundation Partner pricing available for early adopters).

Dear Rev. {{Last Name}},

We’ve launched WOT Digital Solutions to equip ministries with purpose-built digital systems. From custom sermon sites to multi-branch dashboards, we simplify administration so leaders can focus on the ministry of the Word.

I would love to host a short demo for your leadership team this week to show how we:
- Centralize reports and discipleship data
- Automate monthly growth summaries with AI
- Provide secure access for pastors, leaders, and admins

Are you available {{Day}} at {{Time}} or {{Alternate}}? I can send a calendar invite right away.

Grace and excellence,  
{{Your Name}}

## Objection Handling
- **“We’re not ready for AI.”** → Emphasize optional use, manual workflows still supported.
- **“Budget is tight.”** → Highlight Foundation Partner pricing, phased rollout, installment terms.
- **“Our data is sensitive.”** → Reference compliance checklist (GDPR/NDPR, encrypted storage, access controls).
- **“We have no media team.”** → Offer media management add-on or partner referrals.
