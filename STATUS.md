---

## 🎯 Decision Points Needed

**Rev. Premma, please decide:**

### 1. Delegation Strategy
**Question:** Can you hire help or going solo for first 8 weeks?

**Options:**
- **A) Solo Founder Mode** (0-8 weeks) → Hire support Week 9+
- **B) Hire Designer** (Week 3-4) → $200-400 for proposal/video
- **C) Hire VA** (Week 5+) → $150-300/month for leads/CRM

**Recommendation:** Start solo (Weeks 1-4), reassess Week 5

---

### 2. Codex's Role
**Question:** Should Codex flesh out scaffolded docs (finished content) or just templates?

**Options:**
- **A) Full Content Creation** → Codex writes landing page copy, scripts, etc.
- **B) Templates Only** → Codex provides structure, you fill in content
- **C) Hybrid** → Codex does critical items (proposal, landing page), you do rest

**Recommendation:** Hybrid (Option C) - Codex handles Week 1-2 priorities

---

### 3. Sales Timeline
**Question:** Send proposals Week 3 (with mockups) or wait for live demo Week 4?

**Options:**
- **A) Week 3 Soft Launch** → Send proposals with Figma mockups, vision pitch
- **B) Week 4 Hard Launch** → Wait for demo site, send proposals with live link
- **C) Week 2 Super Early** → Gauge interest, pre-sell with vision doc

**Recommendation:** Option A (Week 3) - Start pipeline early, close when demo is live

---

### 4. Time Commitment
**Question:** How many hours/day can you dedicate?

**Options:**
- **A) Full-Time** (8+ hours/day) → Can do everything, aggressive timeline
- **B) Part-Time** (4-6 hours/day) → Focus engineering, defer marketing
- **C) Nights/Weekends** (10-20 hours/week) → Extend timeline to 24 weeks

**Recommendation:** Confirm hours/day to adjust roadmap priorities
