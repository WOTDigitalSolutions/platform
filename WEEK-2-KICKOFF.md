### Business Decisions Needed This Week

## 🚨 Potential Blockers & Mitigation

### Technical Blockers
**Risk:** Supabase integration issues
**Mitigation:** Test connection early (Monday), troubleshoot immediately

**Risk:** Deployment fails
**Mitigation:** Deploy early (Thursday test deploy, Friday final)

**Risk:** Design implementation doesn't match vision
**Mitigation:** Daily reviews with Rev. Premma, iterate quickly

### Business Blockers
**Risk:** Can't find 20-30 leads
**Mitigation:** Start with WOT network, expand to Facebook groups, referrals

**Risk:** Proposal design takes too long
**Mitigation:** Use Canva templates, prioritize content over polish

**Risk:** Too many tasks for one person (Codex)
**Mitigation:** Prioritize critical items (proposal, lead list), defer nice-to-haves

### Coordination Blockers
**Risk:** Rev. Premma unavailable for reviews
**Mitigation:** Batch reviews (end of each day), async approval via screenshots

**Risk:** Claude and Codex working on conflicting priorities
**Mitigation:** This Week 2 kickoff doc = single source of truth, follow the plan

---

## 📞 Communication Channels

### Async (Default)
- **GitHub:** Code commits, issues, PRs
- **This Repo:** Update markdown docs with progress
- **Screenshots:** Share work via images (for async review)

### Sync (When Needed)
- **Quick Calls:** 15-min standups if needed
- **Design Reviews:** Rev. Premma sees live demos
- **Decision Meetings:** When stuck, hop on quick call

**Principle:** Async first, sync when blocked.
