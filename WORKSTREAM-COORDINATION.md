## Questions for Rev. Premma

1. **Delegation:** Can you hire help (designer, writer, VA) or solo for first 8 weeks?
2. **Codex Role:** Should Codex flesh out the scaffolded docs (finished content) or just provide templates?
3. **Sales Timeline:** Are you comfortable sending proposals Week 3 (with mockups) or wait for live demo Week 4?
4. **Time Commitment:** How many hours/day can you dedicate? (Helps prioritize workstreams)
